This directory contains the processed .pickle files containing the mel-scaled spectrograms of the coughs from `dataFiles`, which are then split into training, validation, and testing data. The name of the directory can be changed and adjusted accordingly in the parameters file. **NOTE**: The data in this folder are not publicly available to protect the privacy of the study's participants. However, we provide you with the data set of voluntary coughs recorded at a close distance (0.15m) with the RÃ˜DE NT1000 microphone so that you can run our code.
