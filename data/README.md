This directory contains the processed .pickle files containing the mel-scaled spectrograms of the coughs from `dataFiles`, which are then split into training, validation, and testing data. The name of the directory can be changed and adjusted accordingly in the parameters file. **NOTE**: The data in this folder are not publicly available to protect the privacy of the study's participants. The data contained in the `Rode/close/` directory are randomly generated and do **not** correspond to real mel spectrograms of cough audio data.
